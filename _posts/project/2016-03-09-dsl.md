A [domain-specific language (DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. In many cases, DSLs are created to be used by domain experts to describe features of their domains. On the other hand, ontologies have been used to describe domain knowledge with great success.

If we combine ontologies and DSLs, ontologies can be used to describe domain-specific knowledge and a DSL developed to allow domain expert to implement useful behavior. The ontologies are to be created by the domain experts using either easy-to-use graphic tools or the help of programmers. They can be specific to the problem at hand. The DSL will be developed by programmers to the specific class of problems the experts are interested in.
