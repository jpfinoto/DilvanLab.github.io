title:  "Behavior Based Model for Intelligence"
subheadline:  "BBM"
teaser: "The Behavior Based Model is based in the idea that complex behavior, such as intelligent behavior, can be accomplished by combining the simple behaviors of hundreds of small, very simple agents. The whole is bigger than the sum of its parts."

The **Behavior Based Model** was exploited in [Agents](/old/dilvan/thesis.phd/thesis.html), a system for generation of leaf cells' layout of digital and mixed digital/analogue VLSI circuits (CMOS and BICMOS). Leaf cells are circuits with complexity comparable to MSI (Medium Scale Integration) components. Agents uses [software agents](http://www.cs.umbc.edu/agents/) to layout circuits and check design rules.  They run in parallel to cooperatively solve the design problem. The system had 18400 lines of C++ and Lisp (Scheme) code. A new version of Agents, called **Agents 2**, was developed in Java. This version tests the concepts of the Behavior Based Model on parallel machines, where the small agents can truly run in parallel.
