This project is part of a direct collaboration with [Dr. Amar Das](http://bmir.stanford.edu/people/view.php/amar_k_das), of the [BMIR - Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics](http://bmir.stanford.edu), on a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) - funded project in autism genetics.

The main NIH grant focused on creating semantic technologies that can help clinicians and researchers systematically characterize the multi- faceted presentation of autism and thus permit more reliable analyses of genetic determinants of specific phenotypes.

Our Autism Rule Editor has helped us to address this challenge with a highly innovative, visual-based approach that categorizes, diagrams and elicits rules on autism phenotypes from physicians. This tool is being implemented within a Web-based version of Protégé—the most widely used, open-source software environment for knowledge modeling in biomedicine. We are currently adapting and testing this approach to meet the needs of autism investigators in classifying phenotypes and traits for genome-wide association studies and other genetics research.
