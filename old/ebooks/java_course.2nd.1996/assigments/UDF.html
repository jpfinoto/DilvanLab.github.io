1. Overview</H2>

<UL>
<P>The purpose of this guide is to define and require a standard format
for writing Unit Development Folders (UDF. There are several purposes which
are served by Unit Development Folders:</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<OL>
<LI>Provide an ordely and consistent approach in the development of each
of the units of a program or project.</LI>

<LI>Provide an uniform and visible collection point for all unit documentation
and code.</LI>

<LI>Aid individual discipline in the establishment and attainment of scheduled
unit-level milestones.</LI>

<LI>Provide low-level management visibility and control over the development
process.</LI>

<LI>Management can easily access the status of the unit.</LI>

<LI>Much of the unit's deliverable documentation can be constructed from
the UDF, when development is nearing completion.</LI>

<LI>Most of the information necessary for post-delivery maintenance will
be assembled in one place.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The UDF is established in skeletal form prior to the start of design
and becomes the primary tool for monitoring progress during software development
and testing activities. All UDFs are controlled by a Project Engineer,
who assigns a UDF Custodian (responsible designer) for each UDF. The UDF
will be audited at periodic intervals during the development process by
the responsible Project Engineer to assure that the required format of
the UDF is maintained and to allow complete assessment of unit status to
be made.</P>

<P>The UDF will be maintained in a binder with tabbed sections. Each UDF
will be externally identified by a unique name, descriptive of the unit
contained therein. Each UDF contains directly or provides a reference to
the current documentation for each of its required items.</P>

<P>The UDF Custodians are responsible for assuring that their UDFs are
properly prepared and maintained. The Project Engineers are charged with
assuring that the UDFs are structured uniformly to provide clarity and
ease of inspection. The Project Engineer is also responsible for performing
audits of the UDFs to verify adherence to the standards and requirements
established by this guide.</P>
</UL>

<H2>2. UDF Organization and Content</H2>

<UL>
<P>The organization and contents of a UDF can be adapted to reflect local
conditions or individual projects requirements. The important considerations
in the structuring of a UDF are:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The number of subdivisions is not so large as to be confusing or unmanageable.</LI>

<LI>Each of the sections contributes to the management and visibility of
the development process.</LI>

<LI>The content and format of each section are afequately and unambiguosly
defined.</LI>

<LI>The subdivisions are suficiently flexible to be applicable to a variety
of software types.</LI>

<LI>The individual sections are chronologically ordered as nearly as possible.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The development of the UDF is geared to proceed logically and sequentially,
and each section should be as complete as possible before proceeding to
the next section. This is not always possible, and software development
is usually an interative rather than sequencial process. These situations
only serve to reinforce the need for an ordered process that can be understood
and tracked even under adverse conditions.</P>

<P>A UDF should contain the following sections:</P>
</UL>

<OL>
<H3>2.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>This section contains a UDF cover sheet (figure 1) for the unit and
identifies the status of the components of the UDF. The cover sheet delineates,
for each of the sections, the start and completion dates, responsible originators,
and reviewer sign-offs and dates.</P>

<P>Following the cover sheet is a description of the unit, system overview,
and how the unit fits into the system. A top level structure diagram of
the units components will be provided. Also provide naming conventions
used, plus any unique system capabilities required by the unit.</P>

<P>Following this description, a unit schedule will be included. This schedule
will show the state of all the unit's components. Each component will be
listed along with start date, percent complete, and completion date for
each of the following functions: Design, Code, and Test.</P>

<P>Following each cover sheet, a UDF&nbsp;Change Log should be included
to document all UDF changes subsequent to the time when the unit is put
into a controlled test or maintenance environment..</P>

<H3>2.2 Requirements</H3>

<P>This section will contain as separately tabbed subsections program requirements
specification documentation and the program operating environment. The
program requirements specification subsection will contain a copy of any
current requirements documentation applicable to the unit. The program
operating environment subsection will contain the hardware and operating
system configurations required for the operation of the unit.</P>

<H3>2.3 External Interfaces</H3>

<P>This section contains a detailed data description for all external interfaces
either required or generated by this unit.</P>

<H3>2.4 Design Description</H3>

<P>This section will contain as subsections the design description for
each unit component. Each subsection will contain the component functional
description, the interfaces, the data organization (data dictionary, data
flows), control flows, state diagrams, and PDL describing the process flow.
Throughout the development and maintenance process, each Design subsection
represents the current working version of the design, and therefore will
be maintained and annotated as changes occur to the initial design. The
information presented here should reflect the component's header.</P>

<H3>2.5 Code</H3>

<P>As the unit components are modified, this section contains the listing
for unit component.</P>

<H3>2.6 Unit Test Plan</H3>

<P>This section contains a test plan for the unit and identifies the individual
tests described. A description of each test case will be included.</P>

<H3>2.7 Test Results </H3>

<P>This section contains a compilation of all current successful test case
results and analyses necessary to demonstrate that the unit has been tested
as described in the test plan. Test output should be identified by test
case numbers and results should be annotated to facilitate reviews of this
results by other qualified individuals.</P>

<H3>2.8 Build Procedures</H3>

<P>This section will include a list of all the names of all the appropriate
files (e.g., sourceand object) as well as their locations for system development,
modification, and maintenance. This section will also include the detailed
steps sufficient to supply an operator with the procedures necessary to
produce the executable software.</P>

<H3>2.9 Problems Reports</H3>

<P>This section contains status logs and copies of all Design Problems
Reports, Design Analysis Reports and Discrepancy Reports (as required)
which document all design and code problems and changes experienced by
the unit. This ensures a clear and documented traceability for all problems
and changes incurred.</P>

<H3>2.10 Notes</H3>

<P>This section may be composed of any item pertaining to the unit that
the UDF Custodian wishes to include.</P>

<H3>2.11 Audits/Reviews</H3>

<P>This section will contain copies of all audit/reviews reports applicable
to the UDF. This includes PDL and Code walkthroughs and UDF audits. Include
all notes pertaining to those audits and reviews.</P>
</OL>

<H2>3. UDF Maintenance</H2>

<OL>
<P>After code development and initial baselining, the design responsibility
is unchanged. All changes made to the UDF will be as described in section
2, UDF Organization and Contents, of this guide.</P>
</OL>

<H2>4. Summary</H2>

<UL>
<P>The UDF concept has evolved into a pratical, efective and valuable tool
not only for the management of software development but also for imposing
a structured approach on the total software development process. The structure
and content of the UDF are designed to create a set of milestones at the
unit leval, each of which can be easily observed and reviewed.</P>
