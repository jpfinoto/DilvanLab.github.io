<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The API, which is being studied is composed 
  by three packages that together form the voice SDK Java Technology:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">package javax.speech: has the basic interfaces 
    and implementations for the Engine interface. It also implements the Central class 
    providing access to all the other functions for creating the most important 
    entities of the technology - the synthesizers and recognizers. It is 
    the basis for the remaining packages, remembering that the recognizers and
    synthesizers interfaces extend the Engine interface. This package also has resources for managing the 
    audio received by the Engine and, as a last feature, its SpeechEvent class is
    inherited 
    by all the other events of the API.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">p</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">ackage 
    javax.speech.synthesis: has all the classes and interfaces used for the synthesis
    process. It also provides the Voice class which determines how the synthesis 
    will take place.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">package javax.speech.recognition: the biggest 
    of the packages, implements the recognizing and grammar classes, given their 
    close relation. Also there are the result classes that are very important 
    in this architecture.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The packages are presented in a jar file named 
  ibmjs.jar and the compilation is possible only after adding its fully file system 
  path name to the CLASSPATH system variable. As follows:</font></p>
<table width="78%" border="1" align="center" height="69">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">CLASSPATH = %CLASSPATH% 
        ; .../ibmjs.jar</font></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="center"><b>Table 11 - Updating the CLASSPATH system variable.</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">After that and the proper 
  installation of the IBM ViaVoice software, it is necessary the execution of the
following command 
  line:</font></p>
<table width="78%" border="1" align="center" height="69">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <div align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">java com.ibm.speech.util.Install</font></div>
