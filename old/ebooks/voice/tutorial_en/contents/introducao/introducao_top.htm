<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The <b>Speech Development Kit Java Technology</b> 
  is a Java programming package, 100% object oriented, that uses the 
  speech recognition and synthesis technology known as ViaVoice commercialized by IBM
. This API makes possible to built application interfaces that 
  take advantage of speech.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The recognition and synthesis operations are not processed 
  by the Java software. The kit is just a way to built speech oriented 
  interfaces. Applications &quot;throw&quot; the speech processing to the software 
  behind it, the IBM ViaVoice (commercial or free version).</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">This way, just like any other interface programming 
  models - like GUIs - the Java Speech Kit is also event oriented but now these events 
  are not fired by the mouse or the keyboard, they are created due to human speech 
  via a microphone.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"> As mentioned the software is based upon two 
  major features: speech synthesis and recognition.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"> The recognition can be done through the 
    use of grammars, that are entities providing information about how the
    recognition 
    will be done. There are two kinds of grammars:</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">- dictation: it's specially designed for 
      continuous speech, when the software tries to determine what is being spoken 
      using a wide word database that associates a sound to each word. To increase 
      accuracy and performance, contextual data is considered in order to establish
    the pronounced words. It is possible to use different dictation grammars for
    different domains, such as medicine, engineering or computer science.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">- rule: these grammars use rules, user's&nbsp;
    definitions of what might be spoken and how that will be interpreted by 
      the application. The set of rules can take any size, but usually it is limited 
      by the context in which the application is inserted. In this way, commands might be
    established in execution time to enhance responsiveness.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The voice synthesis might provide the 
    application with simple string sentences as arguments to the method speak. 
    An improved naturalness can be reached via the use of a special markup language 
    - named Java Speech Markup Language (JSML). Through its use properties like voice, 
    frequency, rhythm and volume can be dynamically altered.</font></li>
</ul>
