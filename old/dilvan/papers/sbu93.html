<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Quantico [1] is a simulator for electrical
circuits applied to the analog signal processing using a sampling technique
of signals discrete in time and amplitude. It is a very portable program
currently running in MS-DOS and Unix architectures.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It is divided in three modules for improved
portability:</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><B>Reader module</B> (Gera) reads the input
file written in the Spice Program format, checks it about syntactic correctness
and warns about wrong or dangerous circuit topologies, and generates a
file with all the information for the simulation.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><B>Simulator module</B> (Simula) does the
actual simulation. It shows the progress of it and, at the end, generates
a file with the simulated data.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><B>Viewer module</B> (Osc) shows the simulation
wave forms in a graphic interface resembling the panel of a multi-channel
oscilloscope.&nbsp;<BR>
The idea is present the user with commands that he is already familiar
with, reducing the learning curve of the program.</FONT>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">THE KIND OF SIMULATION</FONT></H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Quantico simulates switched capacitor networks
circuits. Despite the similarity with the circuits simulated by Switcap
[2], Quantico can handle asynchronous switching and capacitive parasites
[3] (but all capacitors must connected to the ground, exception for the
parasitic ones). This means that the switches in Quantico can be commuted
in any time not only during clock transitions, this allows switches not
commanded by clock signals. This isn't possible with the common switched
capacitor network simulators.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In Quantico, switches can be controlled
by clocks or devices inside the circuit, currently it offers comparators
devices for commanding switches. Quantico does a time domain simulation
that allows the presence of no-linear components in the circuits, like
the comparators. Other devices offered by Quantico are: unit-gain voltage
adders, unit-gain buffers, signal dividers, signal subtractors, and various
types of signal sources.</FONT>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">HOW THE SIMULATOR WORKS</FONT></H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The simulator works basically calculating
the voltage value of each of the circuit's independent networks, defined
as parts of the circuits isolated by open switches. Quantico uses a pointed
data structure database, to holds the circuit description, to allow the
program to have knowledge about the circuit topology. When the simulation
begins, additional registers are added to this database to represent the
independent networks throughout the circuits. In those structures is loaded
the voltage value of the networks. In each simulation cycle, Quantico tests
to see if there was a change in the independent networks topology. If in
a certain cycle one independent network didn't changed its topology, its
registers are kept and, if there is at least one signal source on it, its
voltage value is re-calculated. This concept allows the program to calculate
the voltage values and find the new independent networks only when it is
absolutely necessary, saving computing resources, allowing bigger circuits
to be simulated. When a independent network has its topology changed, the
simulator calculates its new voltage and capacitor charges values going
through each component of it. If there is a voltage source (signal sources,
devices outputs, etc.) in the network all nodes connected to it will have
the same voltage value as the source. If there are only capacitors the
net voltage value will be the pondered average of the capacitors voltage
(It is considered that in each clock cycle there is enough time for the
electric charges redistribute among the capacitors). In this charge redistribution
the switches parasitic capacitance are accounted during the calculations.
When the simulator has the voltage values of all independents networks,
it uses them to calculate the new charges in the capacitors, including
the parasitic ones. Following this, the simulator tests if any comparator
changed its state, opening or closing any switch. If there is any alteration
in the circuit independent networks, the voltage values for all networks
that were affected are re-calculated.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The number of times this happens can be
determined by the user to avoid infinite or too long cycles inside a clock
cycle. This ensures time for a stable charge distribution among the capacitors.
It will repeat this cycle until the simulation reaches the total number
of cycles.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>&nbsp;
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">PORTABILITY</FONT></H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">One of the project aims was to produce a portable
program that could run across many architectures and operational systems.
Currently Quantico runs in computers running the MS-DOS and Unix platforms,
like the Sun's Sparc under SunOS 4.1.1 or IBM-PC under Linux.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It was written in ANSI C language for easy
portability. This portability was tested when the Quantico was ported to
Unix platforms. The porting of the Gera and Simula modules was straightforward
needing only minor changes and recompiling. The Osc module, for being more
machine dependent, demanded some rewriting of the I/O graphic routines,
the MS-DOS porting uses the Turbo C graphic library and the Unix versions
the xview graphic library. It took approximately 30 men/hours for the complete
porting.</FONT>

<H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</FONT></H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Distinct sampled data circuits have been simulated
in Quantico and the corresponding results have been compared with those
produced by other simulators whenever applicable.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Results of the simulation of a SERIAL
DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER is presented bellow in order to illustrate
an application of Quantico.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The schematic of the S-DAC is shown in
Figure 1. The complementary pair of switches indicated by SW3 are driven
by the digital input signal, providing a voltage signal at node (2) which
is either Vref or Zero, depending on whether the digital input is One or
Zero, respectively. During N cycles of the main clock, CLK1, where N is
the number of bits of the digital input, the Vref of Zero voltage will
be an input for the discrete mode loop formed by the "divide-by-two" circuit,
the "Unity-gain voltage adder" and the "Hold &amp; Sample" circuit HS1
(driven by clock CLK1), so that at the occurrence of the Kth cycle of the
main clock, within the N-cycle period, the voltage at node(4) is:</FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m=1</PRE>
</UL>
</UL>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">After N cycles of the main clock, when the
output voltage of the Adder corresponds to the analog conversion from the
digital input, the second "Hold &amp; Sample" circuit, HS2, changes its
states and this voltage is sampled in "analog out".</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The corresponding netlist for Quantico
is presented in TABLE 1.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Waveforms from a simulation of this circuit
are shown in figure 2. Channel-1 shows the main clock, channel-2 shows
the digital input stream, channel-3 shows the signal at node (4) and channel-4
shows the analog out waveform.</FONT>
<H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">CONCLUSION</FONT></H2>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Quantico has been used as a tool for the development
of new sampled data circuits. It has proved to be very portable and stable.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Improvements are being carried out, focusing
the ability to simulate parasites, such as overlap capacitance in analog
switches; the ability of reading EDIF 2.0.0 and an schematic capture feature,
aiming to establish a complete simulation environment for sampled-data
circuits.</FONT>
