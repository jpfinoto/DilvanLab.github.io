                  de Abreu Moreira<BR><BR>Introducing, an easy-to-use tool for 
                  keeping track of web page versions.<BR><BR>
                  <P>Information evolves rapidly on the World Wide Web. Because 
                  this, browser users often are surprised when previously 
                  available information is no longer available. To solve this 
                  problem, we created a software tool named VersionWeb that 
                  makes web page version control available during browsing. 
                  <P>The creation of web applications can be seen as a new kind 
                  of software development. Many software companies gradually are 
                  starting to adopt Software Configuration Management (SCM) as a 
                  usual tool for software development. Changes are required 
                  throughout all lifecycles of a system. During the development 
                  of large-scale software, uncontrolled modifications occur and 
                  can lead to chaos. Thus, change-management procedures must be 
                  carried out to ensure that costs and benefits are analyzed and 
                  changes are controlled. Developers of web pages (authors or 
                  webmasters) face hard work when many people are involved in 
                  the parallel development of sets of related pages. Because 
                  authors work independently on their individual copies, the 
                  integration of the copies in a final hyperdocument (merging 
                  two or more versions to generate another) becomes a complicate 
                  issue. In addition, the volume of documents involved usually 
                  is high, so modifications in these documents happen fast and 
                  are difficult to track. In fact, to provide an efficient 
                  mechanism to control change, we should combine human 
                  procedures with automatic tools like SCCS or RCS. 
                  <P>VersionWeb provides webmasters an easy way of controlling 
                  web page versions, through the Web itself. Additionally, 
                  during web browsing, users are able to recover previously 
                  available information from the web page, visualize the 
                  differences between different versions of the page and to 
                  notified when new versions become available. Another objective 
                  of the tool is to facilitate the cooperation among authors, 
                  allowing them to have simultaneous access to the files, manage 
                  the different versions of a file and locate changes that have 
                  been made. 
                  <P>
                  <H3>Architecture of VersionWeb</H3>
                  <P>To provide its main functional features, VersionWeb 
                  encapsulates CVS (Concurrent Version System), an efficient 
                  file version control system. CVS allows simultaneous access to 
                  a file. Access can be made through the Internet, and it is 
                  possible to visualize the differences between two file 
                  versions (except for binary files). CVS can run under several 
                  operating systems. 
                  <P>VersionWeb complements CVS by providing a web-based 
                  interface for friendlier interaction, because CVS has only a 
                  command-oriented interface. To make a CVS repository available 
                  through the Web, it has to be located in the same server as 
                  the web server for security reasons. According to this 
                  approach (shown in Figure 1), its functional components 
                  (Application Interface and CGI Script) work as follows: 
                  <P>
                  <UL>
                    <LI>Users web browsing from anywhere on the Internet 
                    interact with CVS through the VersionWeb Application 
                    Interface and submit requests to the web server (in general, 
                    encapsulating CVS commands). 
                    <LI>A CGI script (physically located on the WWW server) 
                    receives and identifies the requests from the users. 
                    <LI>The CGI script that received the request makes a call to 
                    the CVS to pass it the command to be run. 
                    <LI>The CVS runs the command and returns the results to the 
                    CGI script. 
                    <LI>The CGI script sends the results to the user by creating 
                    an HTML page using the request results. </LI></UL>
                  <P>
                  <CENTER><IMG alt=figure src="VersionWeb_files/6330f1.jpg"><BR>
                  <H4>Figure 1. Basic Architecture of VersionWeb</H4></CENTER>
                  <P>As shown in Figure 1, the CGI Scripts and CVS repository 
                  are located physically in the same computer that hosts the WWW 
                  server. We use CGI scripts because they require simplified 
                  programming. Furthermore, the web user, running from a client 
                  browser, does not have to install the CVS software in his or 
                  her local machine to run VersionWeb. 
                  <P>All tasks are run in the server. Because CVS itself 
                  controls the concurrent access to the files, there is no 
                  missing information or redundancy. To run VersionWeb, the user 
                  needs only a browser. 
                  <P>
                  <H3>The VersionWeb Tool</H3>
                  <P>The web-based interface of VersionWeb was developed to 
                  facilitate user interaction with CVS. Because CVS has only a 
                  command-oriented interface, many developers have avoided using 
                  it. The modular structure of VersionWeb is shown in Figure 2. 
                  <P>
                  <CENTER><IMG alt=figure src="VersionWeb_files/6330f2.jpg"><BR>
                  <H4>Figure 2. VersionWeb Modules</H4></CENTER>
                  <P>VersionWeb has three main interfaces to support the three 
                  different roles of its users: general users (specific groups 
                  of browsing users), administrators and authors. After passing 
                  through the VersionWeb authentication module, the user has 
                  access to one of the three basics interfaces of VersionWeb 
                  according to his or her role. 
                  <P>

                  <H3>General User</H3>
                  <P>If the user has been authenticated as a general user 
                  (belonging to a specific group), he has access to the 
                  interface shown in Figure 4. This type of interface, for 
                  general users, is accessible through the page in which the 
                  user is browsing.

                  <P>This interface has a link to some modules of the tool, 
                  which are responsible for showing links to all the page's 
                  versions and to the following options: 
                  <P>
                  <UL>
                    <LI>Retrieve any version of the page. 
                    <LI>See the differences between page versions. 
                    <LI>Notify of newly available versions. 
                    <LI>Send criticisms or suggestions to authors related to the

                  <P>
                  <H3>Authors</H3>
                  <P>If the user has been authenticated as an author, he has 
                  access to the interface shown in Figure 5, which shows the CVS 
                  repository content requested during user authentication.

                  <H4>Figure 5. File Management in VersionWeb</H4></A>
                  <P>This interface offers the basics options to manipulate 
                  files and directories and to access CVS operations like: 
                  <P>
                  <UL>
                    <LI>List Directory: lists the contents of a directory. 
                    <LI>Up Level: goes up one level in the directory tree. 
                    <LI>Rename: renames a directory or file. 
                    <LI>Delete: removes a directory or file. 
                    <LI>Remote Checkout: makes a remote checkout of the current 
                    file version (in the server side). This option must be used 
                    when doing small changes in text files for immediate 
                    commitment. The file content is edited in a browser window. 
                    <LI>Local Checkout: makes a local checkout of a selected 
                    file current version. This operation lists a directory of 
                    files in a new browser window for downloading. 
                    <LI>Versions History: shows the history log of all versions 
                    of a file. 
                    <LI>Versions List: opens a new window with all versions and 
                    branches of a file with remote and local checkout operations 
                    for each version. 
                    <LI>Diffs: allows the author to visualize the differences in 
                    content between two versions of a file. 
                    <LI>Create directory: creates one directory inside the CVS 
                    repository. 
                    <LI>Add file: uploads a file to the CVS repository. 
                    <LI>Commit of a local checkout: makes the commit of changed 
                    files from a local checkout. </LI></UL>
                  <P>One important VersionWeb feature is to show visually the 
                  differences between two versions of one file with colors, as 
                  shown in Figure 6.

                  <H3>Installation</H3>
                  <P>Installing VersionWeb is simple. The user needs to have 
                  installed CVS (version 1.10 or higher) for Linux, compile the 
                  VersionWeb source files and create a CVS repository. 
                  VersionWeb is available for download at <A 
                  href="http://versionweb.sourceforge.net/" 
                  target=_blank>versionweb.sourceforge.net</A>. Included in the 
                  downloaded material are a command file for compilation (using 
                  gcc), an install file and a user manual.
