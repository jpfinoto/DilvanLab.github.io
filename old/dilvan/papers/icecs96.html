<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>1.0 INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>In the literature, agents are defined as software components that communicate
with their peers by exchanging messages in a communication language <A HREF="#REF1">[1]</A>.
Whilst agents can be as simple as subroutines, usually they are bigger
entities with some sort of persistent control and autonomy. This paper
examines the implementation of agents in the placement server of the Agents
system <A HREF="#REF2">[2]</A> which is a CAD system that generates mask
level layout of full custom leaf cells. Leaf cells are subcircuits of a
complexity comparable with SSI (Small Scale Integration) components such
as one-bit adders, flip-flops or multiplexers.</P>

<P>The Agents system is formed from four server programs: the Placer, Router,
Database and Broker. The Placer places components in a cell, the Router
wires the circuits sent to it, the Database keeps all the information that
is dependent upon the fabrication process, such as the design rules, and
the Broker makes the services of the other servers available. </P>

<P>The Placer server receives from its client the description and netlist
of the circuit to be generated using EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange
Format). It undertakes its tasks by using groups of small software agents
to join leaf cell components in groups and the genetic algorithm to place
them. Their implementation is described below.</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-7"></A></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>2.0 DISTRIBUTED BEHAVIOR</H2>

<P>Agent objects are small agents responsible for all the reasoning undertaken
by the Placer server. The design philosophy is that competence should emerge
out of the collective behavior of a large number of relatively simple agents.
These small agents are implemented as C++ objects. The base class agent
holds the basic inference routines and the derived classes add the knowledge
needed for a particular application <A HREF="#REF3">[3]</A>. </P>

<P>The class agent uses a model based on behaviors. A behavior approach
starts from the view point of behaviors as the fundamental unit of analysis.
A behavior is a regularity in the interaction dynamics between an agent
and its environment <A HREF="#REF4">[4]</A>. For example, when an agent
maintains a certain distance from a wall, as long as this regularity holds,
observers may say that there is an &quot;obstacle avoidance behavior&quot;.
</P>

<P>Each agent object has a &quot;personality&quot; and an aim in life.
Its personality is determined by the set of behaviors it can perform. Changes
in behavior can be dictated by an object's perception of changes in its
environment, similar to the mechanisms present in the interaction of individuals.
Alternatively they can be directly commanded by another agent. In agent
objects, behaviors are implemented through the use of rules which test
external input points, and determine from them which responses are appropriate.</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-11"></A></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>3.0 THE GENETIC ALGORITHM</H2>

<P>The genetic algorithm, first proposed by Holland in 1975 <A HREF="#REF5">[5]</A>,
mimics natural evolution to solve problems in a wide variety of domains
<A HREF="#REF6">[6]</A>. It is particularly suitable for solving complex,
search intensive, optimization problems, such as the placement of component
cells in a leaf cell.</P>

<P>The genetic algorithm is formed from a set of individual elements (the
population) and a set of biological inspired operators, which can change
these individuals. According to evolutionary theory, only the individuals
that are the more suited in the population are likely to survive and to
generate off-spring, thus transmitting their biological heredity to new
generations.</P>

<P>In computing terms, the genetic algorithm maps strings of numbers to
each potential solution. Each solution becomes an individual in the population,
and each string becomes a representation of an individual. There should
be a way to derive each individual from its string representation. The
genetic algorithm then manipulates the most promising strings in its search
for an improved solution. </P>

<P>The algorithm operates through a simple cycle. In each cycle, a new
generation of possible solutions (individuals) for a given problem is produced.
At the first stage, a population of possible solutions is created as a
start point. Each individual in this population is encoded into a string
(the chromosome) to be manipulated by the genetic operators. In the next
stage, the individuals are evaluated, first the individual is created from
its string description (its chromosome) and its performance in relation
to a target response is evaluated. This determines how fit this individual
is in relation to the others in the population. Based on each individual's
fitness, a selection mechanism chooses the best pairs for the genetic manipulation
process. The selection policy is responsible to ensure the survival of
the fittest individuals. Genetic operators are then used to produce new
populations of individuals, the offspring, by manipulating the genetic
information possessed by the pairs chosen to reproduce. This information
is stored in strings (chromosomes) that describe the individuals. </P>

<P>The two main genetic operators used are <I>crossover</I> and <I>mutation</I>.
The offspring generated by this process take the place of the older population
and the cycle is repeated until a desired level of fitness is attained
or a determined number of cycles is reached.</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-17"></A></P>

<H3>3.1 Genetic operators</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Crossover is one of the genetic operators used to recombine the population
genetic material. It takes two chromosomes and swaps part of their genetic
information to produce new chromosomes. This operation is similar to sexual
reproduction in nature. After the crossover point has been randomly chosen,
portions of both parents' chromosomes are combined to produce the new offspring.
The selection process associated with the recombination made by crossover
assures that special genetic structures, called building blocks, are retained
for future generations. These building blocks represent the most fit genetic
structures in the population. </LI>

<LI>Mutation is used because the recombination process alone cannot explore
search space sections not represented in the population's genetic structures.
This could make the search become stuck around local minima. The mutation
operator introduces new genetic structures in the population by randomly
changing some of its building blocks, helping the algorithm escape local
minima traps. Since the modification is totally random and thus not related
to any previous genetic structures present in the population, it creates
different structures related to other sections of the search space. Mutation
is implemented by occasionally altering a random part of a chromosome.</LI>
</UL>

<P>A number of other operators, other than crossover and mutation, have
been introduced since the basic model was proposed. They are usually versions
of the recombination and genetic alteration processes adapted to constraints
of a particular problem. </P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-21"></A></P>

<H3>3.2 Problem dependent parameters</H3>

<P>This description of the genetic algorithm's computational model reviews
the steps needed to create the algorithm. However, a real implementation
takes account of a number of problem-dependent parameters:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The choice of the underlying encoding of the individuals on the population
is critical to the algorithm performance. It is desirable that the encoding
makes the representation as robust as possible. This means that even if
a piece of the representation is randomly changed, in the majority of cases,
it should still represent a viable individual.</LI>

<LI>The evaluation is a step closely related to the actual system the algorithm
is trying to optmize. It takes the strings representing the individuals
of the population, creates from them the actual individuals and then tests
and scores them. The testing depends on those characteristics which should
be optimized and the scoring depends on the relative importance of each
different characteristic value obtained during testing.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Other parameters to be adjusted are the population size, crossover and
mutation rates, evaluation method, and convergence criteria. </P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-26"></A></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>4.0 THE PLACER SERVER</H2>

<P>The Placer server undertakes the placement of circuit components in
a defined area. After reading the design information from its client through
a network in EDIF format, the server performs the placement of components
basically in three steps: </P>

<UL>
<LI>It forms columns of related transistors. These columns can be formed
from MOS transistors that are connected by their gates, MOS transistors
that have their source and drain interconnected (pass pair) or bipolar
transistors that share connections.</LI>

<LI>It forms groups joining columns that share drain or source connections.
As these connections are implemented using diffusion layers, the line of
transistors, formed by joining the MOSFET columns, can be laid out in the
same strip of diffusion.</LI>

<LI>It performs the layout of each cell by placing the groups using genetic
algorithm techniques and by calling Router servers to route them.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The best placement successfully routed becomes the final circuit. This
circuit is then sent back to the client application, again, as an EDIF
description.</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-32"></A></P>

<H3>4.1 Column formation</H3>

<P>There are three kinds of agent objects for placement: the <I>Cont</I>
agent object controls all the operations; the <I>Abutted</I> agent object
first builds columns of related transistors and subsequently tries to unite
with other Abutted agents to form groups, and the <I>Eval</I> agent object
uses the genetic algorithm to find a good placement for the groups.</P>

<P>The Cont agent coordinates all the actions. It receives the new circuit
as a list, after it has been interpreted from EDIF. It separates the NMOS,
PMOS and bipolar transistors and general cells in different lists and creates
the first Abutted agent.</P>

<P>An Abutted agent has two behaviors. When it is created it performs its
first behavior: it goes to the lists of available cells in the Cont agent,
and grabs the first cell it can obtain in the following order: NMOS, PMOS,
bipolar or general cell. Then it tries to create the biggest possible column
formed by other related cells:</P>

<UL>
<LI>It tries to join MOS transistors that have their gates connected or
form a pass pair (two transistors which have their source and drain interconnected).
</LI>

<LI>It tries to join bipolar transistors that share interconnections.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When an agent forms its column of transistors or gets a cell, it tries
to reproduce. If there are more cells to be obtained in the Cont agent,
a new Abutted agent is created and it tries to obtain its own set of cells.
Abutted agents behave like a culture of bacteria, they keep reproducing
until there is no more &quot;food&quot; (cells).</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-39"></A></P>

<H3>4.2 Group formation</H3>

<P>When the column creation process finishes, the Abutted agents switch
to their second behavior, group formation. They now try to pair up with
other agents by joining columns of MOSFETs together. Only Abutted agents
holding MOSFETs' columns can pair up. The group formation process is performed
in cycles controlled by the Cont agent. In this process only Abutted agents
holding columns of MOSFETs are considered. In each cycle, the Cont agent
goes through the list of Abutted agents, exposes each agent to the others
and asks the other agents how well they connect to this agent. Each agent
then creates a report showing its situation relating to the exposed agent.
This report states if a match is possible, how good this match is and details
how it should be implemented. At the end of a cycle, the two agents that
have the best connections between each other are joined. These cycles continue
until no agents can be joined or the quality of the possible connections
is too poor.</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-41"></A></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>5.0 THE GENETIC ALGORITHM PLACEMENT</H2>

<P>After formation, the group placement is optimized using the genetic
algorithm encapsulated in the Eval agent object. The inputs for the Eval
agent are an empty leaf cell and a list holding the groups of components
to be placed. The empty leaf cell is the same as that received by the server.
The list of groups comes from the Cont agent and it holds three kinds of
groups of components: arrays of MOSFETs, a list of bipolar transistors
and individual general cells. The Eval agent has to position them in the
empty cell in the best possible way. Before describing the actual algorithm
implementation, some steps should be defined because they are closely related
to the system being optimized. There are two main points to be defined:
encoding and evaluation.</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-43"></A></P>

<H3>5.1 Encoding</H3>

<P>Each individual solution in the population is represented by a chromosome
and this representation should be as robust as possible. Figure <A HREF="#fig1">1</A>
shows an individual and figure <A HREF="#fig2">2</A> the chromosome that
represents it. The chromosome is not represented by a string, as would
be expected, but by a list. This avoids Hamming cliffs <A HREF="#REF6">[6]</A>
and enhances robustness. The elements of this list represent each group
being laid out. For each group there is another list describing how that
particular group will be laid out. This list has the following elements:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Group number</B>, the group's identification.</LI>

<LI><B>Flip flag</B>, indicating if the group is to be mirrored in the
Y axis.</LI>

<LI><B>Line list</B>, a list with the order that the lines in the group
should be laid out. </LI>

<LI><B>Dx</B>, representing the distance between this group and the last
group laid out.</LI>

<LI><B>Dy</B>, representing the distance between the group and the Y axis.</LI>

<LI><B>Gap</B>, which is the gap added to the minimum separation between
a cell's transistors.</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="fig1"></A><IMG SRC="icecs96-1.gif" HEIGHT=301 WIDTH=409></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="fig2"></A><IMG SRC="icecs96-2.gif" HEIGHT=206 WIDTH=441></P></CENTER>

<P>With the information provided by the chromosome, the individual, shown
in figure <A HREF="#fig1">1</A>, is laid out in a cell containing only
the pads (Vss, Vee, Input and Output). The way the genetic operations are
carried out is dependent upon the chosen encoding for the genes. As figure
<A HREF="#fig3">3</A> shows, when two individuals mate, their genetic material
mix, in this case the list containing placement information for each group.
A parent is chosen randomly to be the main parent, the order of the groups
in its chromosome determining the order in the offspring chromosome. In
figure <A HREF="#fig3">3</A>, parent 1 was chosen as the main parent, the
order of groups in the offspring reassembling its own. However placement
information came randomly from both parents. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="fig3"></A><IMG SRC="icecs96-3.gif" HEIGHT=226 WIDTH=366></P></CENTER>

<P>After an offspring has been generated, mutation operations can be applied.
At the top level, mutation can be used to swap the position of some groups
in the offspring. Inside each group description, cross-over and mutation
can happen. The FLIP flag can be changed by mutation and the group's lines
can be swapped.</P>

<P>Cross-over and mutation operations can generate <I>illegal</I> individuals
(placements that violate design rules). When evaluated they will be classified
as &quot;born dead&quot; individuals and will not be added to the population
list. </P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-54"></A></P>

<H3>5.2 Evaluation</H3>

<P>The created individuals are evaluated to determine how good their placement
is. The evaluation routine uses the same wiring algorithms that the router
uses but does not test for design rule violations. All connections are
carried out with the smallest wire possible. As the evaluation pseudo routing
takes place, the cost of the wires is computed. The routine that calculates
the cost of each wire is the same as the one used by the router. The number
of crossings of each new wire with all the old ones, already laid out,
is accumulated. At the end, the evaluation routine calculates a fitness
value from the total cost of the pseudo routing and the total number of
crossings.</P>

<P>The whole population of individuals is kept in a list, which is ordered
by fitness with the fittest individuals coming first in the list. Every
new individual is appended to this list in the appropriate position. </P>

<P>The offspring produced by genetic manipulation (the next population
to be evaluated) replace its less fit members (steady-state approach).
New individuals are thus continuously appended to the population list.
When the population reaches a predetermined maximum number, half of it
is killed.</P>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-58"></A></P>

<H3>5.3 Implementation of the Algorithm</H3>

<P>The inputs for the Eval agent are an empty cell and a list holding the
groups of components to be placed. When the Eval agent is created it generates
four individuals by placing then randomly. These individuals are then evaluated
and classified becoming the population. The program then runs a certain
number of generations or cycles. When it finishes it sends the placed circuit
to be wired by a router server. The Cont agent refines the placement of
a circuit by doing placement/routing cycles. First, the Cont agent runs
a number of generations in the Eval agent to produce a placement for the
design and then it sends it to a Router server. This cycle is repeated
until one of the router servers successfully wires one design. An example
of a placed circuit is shown in figure <A HREF="#fig4">4</A>.</P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="fig4"></A><IMG SRC="icecs96-4.gif" HEIGHT=254 WIDTH=376></P></CENTER>

<P><A NAME="HEADING1-60"></A></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>6.0 CONCLUSION</H2>

<P>The genetic algorithm is a very powerful and flexible optimization algorithm.
The Placer server within the <B>Agents</B> system, uses it in conjunction
with small behavior based software agents to generate layout flexibly.
It offers the designer flexibility in that a richer set of layout options
and fabrication process independence are available. Finally, the use of
a standard circuit description language (EDIF) facilitates the integration
of the program in other design systems.</P>
