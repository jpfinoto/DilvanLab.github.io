      work.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p><p>In this exercise, you'll design and implement an abstract type.
      Designing an abstract type involves determining what services it should
      provide and what their behavior should be -- that is, writing a
      specification. Implementing an abstract type involves choosing a
      representation and algorithms, and embodying them in code. The focus of
      the exercise is the design, so you should expect to spend a considerable
      amount of time on it. To check that your design is feasible, you'll use
      your type to build a small program that finds T directions using a map
      of the Boston subway that we provide.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Graphs</strong></span></p><p>The abstract type that you'll design is a directed labelled
      multi-graph. A graph is just a collection of nodes with edges between
      them. Every edge connects one node to one other node. There can be nodes
      without edges but no edges without nodes. A node may be connected to
      itself. There can be zero, one or more edges between a pair of nodes.
      Every edge has a label; distinct edges may have the same label.</p><p>Here are some examples of applications of directed labelled
      multi-graphs.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A compiler may represent the control flow of a program as a
          graph whose nodes are points in the program, and whose edges are
          program statements. The graph would be used for analyses, such as
          propagating the values of constants, and for transformations, such
          as hoisting a statement out of a loop.</p></li><li><p>A website design tool may represent a website as a graph whose
          nodes are documents and whose edges are links. The tool may examine
          the site for connectivity, find broken links, update all documents
          when a document is moved, and so on.</p></li><li><p>A curriculum design tool may use a graph to show prerequisite
          relationships between courses, to find inconsistencies and determine
          feasible programs of study.</p></li><li><p>A program for generating driving directions may use a graph to
          represent a street map, and compute a shortest path to find
          directions from one point to another.</p></li><li><p>A Java&#8482; compiler may use a graph to represent dependences
          between source code files, and to determine a reasonable order of
          compilation.</p></li></ul></div><p>Your type will be used to find directions on the Boston subway, so
      in its use, the nodes will represent stations and the edges will
      represent track segments. But your design and implementation should be
      <span class="bold"><strong>polymorphic</strong></span> . This means that the node
      type should be generic; it should be possible to use your graph design
      and implementation in different applications.</p><p>Your graph implementation must be <span class="bold"><strong>efficient</strong></span>. This means it should perform
      reasonably for medium sized graphs -- those consisting of thousands (but
      not millions) of nodes and edges. You should not assume that the graph
      will be <span class="bold"><strong>sparse</strong></span> (that is, containing
      very few edges compared to nodes) or <span class="bold"><strong>dense</strong></span> (that is, with most node pairs
      connected).</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Ideas</strong></span></p><p>To give you some sense of the kinds of issues you should be
      considering in your design, here are some questions you might want to
      consider. These don't in general have simple answers. You'll need to
      exercise careful judgment, and think carefully about how decisions you
      make interfere with each other.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>will the graph be mutable or immutable? will it be possible to
          change the label of an edge?</p></li><li><p>will the graph allow edges without labels?</p></li><li><p>will edge labels be strings or generic objects? if objects,
          will it be OK to use a node or an edge as a label? or even a
          graph?</p></li><li><p>will nodes be required only to satisfy the interface of
          java.lang.Object? or will you design a Java&#8482; interface for
          nodes?</p></li><li><p>will the graph be implemented as a single class, or will there
          be a separate Java&#8482; interface for the Graph specification, and a
          class for the implementation?</p></li><li><p>will edges be objects in their own right? will they be visible
          to a client of the abstract type?</p></li><li><p>will it be possible to find the successor of a node from the
          node alone, or will the graph be needed too? can a node belong to
          multiple graphs?</p></li><li><p>what kind of iterators will the type provide?</p></li><li><p>should path-finding operations be included as methods of the
          graph, or should they be implemented in client code on top of the
          graph?</p></li><li><p>will the type provide any views, like the set view returned by
          the entrySet method of java.util.Map?</p></li><li><p>will the type implement any standard Java&#8482; collection
          interfaces?</p></li><li><p>will the type use any standard Java&#8482; collections in its
          implementation?</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e9466"></a>6.1.&nbsp;Problem 1: Graph Specification</h3></div></div></div><p>Design an abstract data type for a directed, labelled graph.
        Your record of your design should be included in one or more files
        distinct from the source code itself, and should include at least the
        following elements:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A brief overview paragraph saying <span class="bold"><strong>what
            classes or interfaces</strong></span> are visible to clients of the

            dependency diagram</strong></span> showing the relationships between
            them.</p></li><li><p>A comment on the <span class="bold"><strong>computational
            complexity</strong></span> of the graph: say which methods you expect
            to be computationally intensive, and give a bound on their
            asymptotic cost, and give a bound on the space requirements. For
            example, you may say (rather implausibly) that addNode will be the
            most costly method, that, as the graph grows, its cost should
            increase at most quadratically with the size of the graph, and
            that the memory required to represent the graph will grow
            exponentially with the number of edges.</p></li><li><p>For each public class or interface: <span class="bold"><strong>an
            overview paragraph</strong></span> explaining in abstract terms what
            objects are represented by that class or interface, and whether
            they are mutable or not; <span class="bold"><strong>a
            specification</strong></span> of each method.</p></li><li><p>A brief <span class="bold"><strong>design rationale</strong></span>
            (no more than half a page long) listing, as separate points, a
            variety of alternative design features that you considered but
            rejected, with explanations of why they were rejected.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e9502"></a>6.2.&nbsp;Problem 2: Graph Implementation</h3></div></div></div><p>Implement the graph and test your implementation using

        system. It should accept two station names as input on the command
        line, and output a list of steps to be taken.</p><p>A simple breadth-first search is adequate. Don't worry about
        handling the kinds of complications a real program would have to
        handle (such as selecting a Green Line train at Park Street, and
        amalgamating steps into journeys on individual lines).</p><p>We have written some code that parses the file describing the
        Boston subway system. This file <code class="filename">bostonmetro.txt</code>
        should be an input to the program. The code in question is found in
        <code class="filename">MetroMapParser.java</code>. You should make
        modifications to this file, by inserting calls to your Graph ADT
        methods. Depending on how you have designed your ADT, these calls will
        be different. For example, if you have built an immutable Graph, you
        might have to collect all the information from the file before you
        build your Graph. However, if you have built a mutable Graph, you
        might be able to build it up incrementally as the file is parsed. In
        any case, you should read through the parser code carefully, and
        provide clear documentation on the modifications you are
        making.</p><p>You should hand in:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Tastefully commented source code;</p></li><li><p>Sample output for some test cases.</p></li><li><p>Provided code</p></li></ol></div><p>The following classes are all provided for you, in source code

     * This class reads a text description of a metro subway system
     * and generates a graph representation of the metro.
     *
     * Students should feel free to modify this code as needed
     *  to complete this exercise.
     *
     *&lt;p&gt;
     *
     * The grammar for the file is described below in BNF. A typical line
     * in the file looks like this :
     *
     * &lt;code&gt; 20 NorthStation   Green 19 22  Orange 15 22  &lt;/code&gt;
     *
     * where :
     *         20 is the StationID
     *         NorthStation is the StationName
     *         Green 19 22
     *                  Green is the LineName
     *                  19 is the StationID of the outbound station
     *                  22 is the StationID of the inbound station
     *         Orange 15 22 is a LineID in which :
     *                  Orange is the LineName
     *                  15 is the StationID of the outbound station
     *                  22 is the StationID of the inbound station
     *
     *         Therefore, NorthStation has two outgoing lines.
     *
     *  note : 0 denotes the end of a line : i.e. in this case,
     *  OakGrove would be at the end of the line, as there is no other outbound 
     *  station.

        s)</code> method to be of use in converting
        <code class="computeroutput">String</code>'s into int's.</p><p>Although it is generally a bad idea to start coding before you
        have thought deeply, it often makes sense to work incrementally,
        interleaving design and coding. Once you have a sketch of your
        specification, you may want to write some experimental code. This
        should give you some concrete feedback on how easy it is to implement
        the methods you've specified. You may even want to start at the end,
        and write the code that uses your type, so that you can be confident
        that the methods you provide will be sufficient.</p><p>This strategy can backfire and degenerate into mindless hacking,
        leaving you with a pile of low-quality code and an incoherent
        specification. To avoid that, bear two things in mind. First, you must
        be willing to start again: experimental code isn't experimental if
        you're not prepared to throw it away. Second, whenever you start
        coding, you must have a firm idea of what you're trying to implement.
        There's no point starting to code to a specification that is vague and
        missing crucial details. That doesn't mean that your specification
        must be complete and polished, but it does mean that you shouldn't
        start coding a method until at least you have its own specification
        written. Third, should must write down the specification of a method
        and not just imagine it; it's too easy to delude yourself. Try to
        write it on paper and mull it over before you start any coding. It's
        tempting to sit in front of an editor, write some specification as
        comments, and then start coding around them, but this tends not to be
        nearly so effective.</p></div></div><copyright><p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; 1998-2009 Dilvan Moreira</p></copyright><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="exercises_java_exercises.html"><img src="../../images/prev.gif" alt="Prev"></a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="exercises.html"><img src="../../images/up.gif" alt="Up"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="individual_assignments.html"><img src="../../images/next.gif" alt="Next"></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">5.&nbsp;Java Exercises&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="../../images/home.gif" alt="Home"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;21.&nbsp;Individual Assignments - Laboratory</td></tr></table></div><script type="text/javascript">
